    <h1>不婚主义</h1>
    <p>如果你是个不婚主义，通常属于两种人。一种是从小得到的爱太多太满，所以长大了你不愿意去改变自己，不愿意因为别人而妥协自己，所以你放弃与别人相处生活，宁愿一个人。两一种是从小太少得到爱，导致你长大了不会去爱，不懂去爱，不知道怎么与人去相处。所以归根究底是两种极端下所产生的一种心理反应。那么那些走进婚姻的必定是从小爱得到均衡的。无伦是不婚还是结婚，都是自己的选择，你能够接受自己选择的结果就好

        <h1>Unmarrialism</h1>
        <p>If you are an unmarried person, you usually belong to two kinds of people. One is that you get too much love from childhood, so you don't want to change yourself when you grow up, and you don't want to compromise yourself because of others, so you give up living with others and prefer to be alone. One is that you get too little love from childhood, which leads you to grow up not to love, do not know how to love, and do not know how to get along with others. So in the final analysis, it is a psychological reaction under the two extremes. Then those who enter marriage must have a balanced love from childhood. Whether Wu Lun doesn't marry or marries is his choice. It's good if you can accept the result of your choice
